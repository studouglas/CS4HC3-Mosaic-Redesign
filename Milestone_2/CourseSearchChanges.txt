Changes made to Course Search criteria page from rev0 to rev1:
-condensed the two different search criteria's into 1
	-less confusion, more visibility
	-new hierarchical search method offers better conceptual map
-removed 'term' search criteria
	-was decided to be unnecessary
	-during registration process students are generally
	 concerned with material of courses, schedule management is 
	 handled later
-removed 'enroll' and 'required courses' buttons
	-extra and somewhat inconsistent as there are already 
	 buttons for these in the top navbar
